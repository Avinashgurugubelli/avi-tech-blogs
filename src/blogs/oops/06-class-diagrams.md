# 📘 Class Diagram in Object-Oriented Design

## 🧱 What is a Class Diagram?

A **Class Diagram** is the backbone of object-oriented modeling. It represents the **static structure** of a system by showing:

- **Classes**
- **Attributes**
- **Methods**
- **Relationships** (associations, inheritance, etc.)

It models how different **entities** (like people, objects, and data) relate to one another.

## 🎯 Purpose of Class Diagrams

Class diagrams are used for:

- ✅ Analyzing and designing the **static view** of an application  
- ✅ Describing the **responsibilities** of a system  
- ✅ Providing a base for **component and deployment diagrams**  
- ✅ Supporting **forward and reverse engineering**

## 🧩 Class Representation

A class is drawn as a rectangle split into **three sections**:
