# Facade Design Pattern

The **Facade Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the system and provides a client with an easy-to-use interface.

---

## üëì Real-World Analogy

Think of a **universal remote**. Instead of using multiple remotes for TV, sound system, and gaming console, you use one remote to control all.

- TV, Sound System, and Console = complex subsystems
- Universal Remote = facade

---

## üéØ Intent

> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. The Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use

- You want to **simplify usage** of a complex or poorly designed API.
- You need to **decouple** a system from complex subsystems.
- You want to **minimize dependencies** between subsystems and clients.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Participants

| Role     | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Facade   | Offers a simple interface to the complex subsystems |
| Subsystems | Perform the actual work behind the scenes |
| Client   | Uses the Facade instead of directly accessing subsystems |

## üß± Structure (Mermaid)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Facade {
        +operation()
    }

    class SubsystemA {
        +actionA()
    }

    class SubsystemB {
        +actionB()
    }

    class SubsystemC {
        +actionC()
    }

    Facade --> SubsystemA : uses
    Facade --> SubsystemB : uses
    Facade --> SubsystemC : uses
```

## Code Example

```java
// Subsystems
class CPU {
    void freeze() { System.out.println("Freezing CPU..."); }
    void execute() { System.out.println("Executing CPU instructions..."); }
}

class Memory {
    void load(long position, byte[] data) {
        System.out.println("Loading data to memory at position " + position);
    }
}

class HardDrive {
    byte[] read(long lba, int size) {
        System.out.println("Reading " + size + " bytes from disk at " + lba);
        return new byte[size];
    }
}

// Facade
class Computer {
    private final CPU cpu;
    private final Memory memory;
    private final HardDrive hardDrive;

    public Computer() {
        this.cpu = new CPU();
        this.memory = new Memory();
        this.hardDrive = new HardDrive();
    }

    public void startComputer() {
        cpu.freeze();
        byte[] data = hardDrive.read(100, 4096);
        memory.load(0, data);
        cpu.execute();
    }
}

// Client
public class FacadeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer computer = new Computer();
        computer.startComputer();
    }
}
```

### Output
```
Freezing CPU...
Reading 4096 bytes from disk at 100
Loading data to memory at position 0
Executing CPU instructions...

```

### ‚úÖ Benefits
- Simplifies API usage for clients.

- Reduces coupling between client and subsystems.

- Provides better control over subsystem behavior.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks
- Can become a god object if it tries to do too much.
- May hide important subsystem features from clients.
