## Introduction
This blog focuses on the inherent challenges of distributed systems: partial failures, unreliable networks, time/clock issues, and distributed consensus

### 1. Partial Failure in Distributed Systems
Key idea: In distributed systems, individual components may fail, while others function—this is called partial failure. Such failures can lead to "split brain" or inconsistent views of the system.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Distributed System
    A[Node 1] -->|Heartbeat| B[Node 2]
    A -->|Heartbeat| C[Node 3]
    B -->|Heartbeat| C
    end

    subgraph Partial Failure Scenario
    D[Network Partition] -->|Blocks communication| A
    D -->|Allows communication| B
    D -->|Allows communication| C
    end

    subgraph Consequences
    E[Split Brain]
    F[Inconsistent State]
    G[Conflicting Decisions]
    end

    A -.->|Cannot communicate| B
    B -->|Elects new leader| C
    A -->|Still considers itself leader| E
    E --> F
    E --> G
```
Diagram: Network partition causes two parts of a cluster to become isolated—each may believe they are still operating normally.

### 2. Unreliable Networks
Key idea: Networks can be unreliable, leading to message loss, duplication, or reordering.
This can cause inconsistencies in data and complicate communication between distributed components.

    A[Client Request] --> B[Node 1]
    Q[Node 2] --> R[Client Response]
