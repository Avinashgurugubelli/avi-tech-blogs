# ðŸ“˜ Beyond MapReduce â€“ Summary

## ðŸ”¹ MapReduce Limitations

- **Popular but limited**: MapReduce became a widely used model for distributed batch processing, but it's not ideal for all use cases.
- **Hard to use directly**: Complex workflows like joins are difficult to express in raw MapReduce.
- **Intermediate state**: Every job writes its output to disk (materialization), which slows down the pipeline and increases I/O overhead.

## ðŸ”¹ High-Level Abstractions Over MapReduce

- Tools like **Hive**, **Pig**, and **Cascading** were built to simplify batch data processing.
- These tools translate high-level queries or scripts into one or more MapReduce jobs.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Drawbacks of MapReduce

- **Workflow inefficiency**: Each stage must complete before the next begins.
- **Redundant mappers**: Common scenario where mappers just re-read the reducer output.
- **High I/O cost**: Materializing intermediate data to HDFS or similar storage is often unnecessary and expensive.

## ðŸ”¹ Rise of Dataflow Engines

Tools like **Spark**, **Tez**, and **Flink** offer more expressive and efficient alternatives:

- Workflows are modeled as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** of operators.
- These engines support operations like `join`, `groupBy`, `filter`, not just `map` and `reduce`.
- Operators can be **pipelined**: data can flow through multiple stages without intermediate disk writes.

### âœ… Benefits

- **Reduced I/O**: Intermediate results are kept in memory or local disk.Only write expensive operations (like sorting) or materializations when truly needed.
- Chain operators directlyâ€”no unnecessary stages or redundant reads/writes.

- Allow pipelined execution (later stages start processing as soon as input is ready).

- Intermediate data is often kept in RAM or local disk (not always replicated across the cluster).

- The engine can optimize placement for data locality, reducing expensive network transfer.

## ðŸ”¹ Fault Tolerance

- **MapReduce**: Achieves fault tolerance via durable intermediate data on disk.
- **Modern engines**: Prefer recomputation over materialization.
  - Spark, Flink, and Tez skip writing all intermediate data to disk for performance, but must keep track of how data was derived to recover from failures (e.g., Spark RDDs, Flink snapshot-based state checkpoints).
  - If a failure occurs, these engines can recompute lost data, but this only works if computation is deterministic (same input â†’ same output). Non-deterministic operators need special care.
- These rely on **deterministic operations** to ensure correctness when recomputing lost stages.

## ðŸ”¹ Materialization in Dataflow

- Dataflow engines avoid unnecessary intermediate writes, except:
  - Final output is still saved to persistent storage (e.g., HDFS, S3).
  - Certain operations like `sort` or large `shuffle` phases still require full materialization.
- This significantly improves performance for most analytics workloads.
